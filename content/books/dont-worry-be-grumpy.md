### Don't Worry, Be Grumpy: Ajahn Brahm


Reading Ajahn is like speaking to your closest wise friend. A friend who is always there for you offering unconditional love, compassion and kindness. With a touch of gentle humor tucked between the stories, this book is wonderful exploration of human spirit. If you really think about it, it is the stories that keep us grounded, it is the stories we tell ourselves about us and others.

Recommended read!

Two of the quotes I really liked:

"When life shovels shit on you, shrug it off, tread it in and you will always stand higher in life."

"Comprehending that happiness has a crack in it teaches us to never take joy for granted..Realizing that one day our lives will break apart makes us see that each moment is precious"
