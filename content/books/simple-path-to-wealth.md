I was disappointed that I did not find this book before I got into workforce. I did not read any financial help books because I was suspicious of marketing tricks.

This little gem has a very simple advice for building wealth and becoming financially independent from 9-to-5 job. It is US-specifc but the principles could be applied to any country.

As I look back and think about my younger self, I wanted to be free from thinking about money all the time. Ofcourse, money is important, otherwise I wouldn't be able to read this book and write a review. In this age of overabundance and consumerism, this book is enlightening in the sense that it shows that anyone can become financially independent and pursue the things they like if they are dillegent about their spending and savings.

This book provides a path to get out of the rat race and be peaceful with yourself. I would totally recommend this book to anyone.
