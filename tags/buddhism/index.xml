A friend who is always there for you offering unconditional love, compassion and kindness. With a touch of gentle humor tucked between the stories, this book is wonderful exploration of human spirit. If you really think about it, it is the stories that keep us grounded, it is the stories we tell ourselves about us and others.</description></item></channel></rss>
