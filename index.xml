We strive for security, comfort, love, respect while our brains are inherently tuned to be selfish and greedy. Successful investing requires long term thinking and the ability to delay our instant gratification. Morgan conveys his thoughts through very good stories.
This is easily the best book in this genre, Morgan sells nothing. It takes you ahead of the curve. Must read!</description></item><item><title>The Simple Path to Wealth</title><link>https://sandeep42.github.io/books/simple-path-to-wealth/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sandeep42.github.io/books/simple-path-to-wealth/</guid><description>I was disappointed that I did not find this book before I got into workforce. I did not read any financial help books because I was suspicious of marketing tricks.
This little gem has a very simple advice for building wealth and becoming financially independent from 9-to-5 job. It is US-specifc but the principles could be applied to any country.
As I look back and think about my younger self, I wanted to be free from thinking about money all the time.</description></item></channel></rss>
