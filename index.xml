Life is Duhkha . The cause of suffering is unsatisfactoriness. Damn, those Buddhists were so right, weren&amp;rsquo;t they? You are damned if you do and damned if you don&amp;rsquo;t. Seek too much pleasure, you suffer. Seek too much pain (as in exercise), you suffer. Be humble, do the thing that needs to be done.</description></item><item><title>Who We Are and How We Got Here</title><link>https://sandeep42.github.io/books/who-are-we-and-how-we-got-here/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sandeep42.github.io/books/who-are-we-and-how-we-got-here/</guid><description>Who We Are and How We Got Here : David Reich New technologies in science are enabling us to unravel the secrets in the ancient DNA, this book a dense introduction to latest research in mapping our origin&amp;rsquo;s story.

I did not read any financial help books because I was suspicious of marketing tricks.
This little gem has a very simple advice for building wealth and becoming financially independent from 9-to-5 job. It is US-specifc but the principles could be applied to any country.
As I look back and think about my younger self, I wanted to be free from thinking about money all the time.</description></item></channel></rss>
